### Step 4: Activate GitHub Pages

3. Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.

## 🌐 Expected Live URL
Your website URL will look like this:

If your username is `johndoe` and your repo is `my-portfolio`:
`https://johndoe.github.io/my-portfolio/`
